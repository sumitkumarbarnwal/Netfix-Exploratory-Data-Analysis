Yo, I just dove into this movie dataset with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, and let me tell ya—it’s wild what you can uncover from a plain ol’ CSV! I cleaned it up, transformed it, and made some dope visuals to spill the tea on movies. 😎🎬 What’s This All About?
I got my hands dirty with some serious EDA, digging into:Movie Genres: What’s hot and what’s not in the genre game.Audience Ratings Over Time: How folks have been vibing with movies across the years.Popularity Breakdown: Sorting flicks into “whoa, that’s popular” vs. “underrated gem” categories.Data Wrangling: Smashed through missing data, funky outliers, and got it ready for the spotlight.Visuals Galore: Whipped up plots that make the data pop!

This project leveled up my data skills big time, and I’m hyped about the insights I pulled outta this thing. A CSV turning into a story? Mind. Blown.📊 Cool Visuals to Check OutJump into the Jupyter Notebook (movie_eda.ipynb) for some sick visualizations like:Bar charts showing which genres rule.Trendy lines of ratings over decades.Scatter plots for popularity vs. how much people loved ‘em.Heatmaps to see what’s clicking with what.
